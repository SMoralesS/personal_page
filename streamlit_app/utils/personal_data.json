    "personal_description": "Since I was a child I have been passionate about science, research, and computing, for this reason, I decided to study physics, where I have followed a focus line in complex systems and artificial intelligence topics, that allowed me to actively belong to Biophysics group of the Universidad de Antioquia in a project on information theory in neural networks. After this experience and until I graduated, I belonged to the group of Theoretical Physics and Applied Mathematics, led by Professor Leonardo Pach√≥n in projects about symmetries in quantum mechanics and artificial intelligence applied to quantum coherence spectra analysis (as thesis project).  \n This experienced led me to search for more specialized studies in this topic. Then, with the help of a Santander Scholarship, I did my Master studies in Applied and Computational Mathematics where I had the opportunity to work in the implementation of methods to solve Partial Differential Equation using Artificial Neural Networks.  \n I consider myself an active and disciplined person, and this has allowed me to participate in activities of competitive level, both in the sports field and in the academic field, reaching even international recognition such as the silver medal in Latin American University Physics Olympiad twice.",
